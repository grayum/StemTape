# Validation record

## 0.3.0 — development candidate

- 21 Node tests and JavaScript syntax checks passed. Stable equal-position sorting, elapsed-time ordering and persistence after manual moves are covered.
- Browser suite updated for completed edits, direct arrow clicks, manual-order persistence, new copy and alphabetized symbols. Browser suite remains unexecuted: Chromium is unavailable in this workspace.
- `makeSheet` and `preparePrint` match 0.2.0 exactly; storage schema remains version 1.
- The Git-based private-file check could not run because this source directory is not a Git checkout. Archive entries were checked for private deployment files.
- Docker, browser visual/touch/PDF verification, production proxy checks and image/secret scanning remain pending. This archive is a development candidate for testing, not a release approved under AGENTS.md.


## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-28

Completed in this workspace:
- All 19 Node tests passed, including the five new icon keys through CSV/JSON, stable-ID row reordering, invalid move rejection and selectable vector-symbol coverage.
- Browser JavaScript and browser-test suite pass syntax checks.
- Default local Compose example and its uncommented Traefik form parse as YAML. Assertions confirm localhost-only ports by default and no app host ports in the Traefik form. Standalone VPS YAML parses too. This is not Docker runtime/Compose semantic validation.
- Exact source comparison confirms `makeSheet` and `preparePrint` are unchanged from 0.1.0.
- New symbols visually inspected together after SVG rendering.
- Browser tests expanded for drag/drop, keyboard movement, Escape cancellation, privacy copy, attribution link and new icon selection. They have not run successfully here: the environment previously lacked Chromium and its download failed. Mouse/touch/pen behavior and mobile visual layout still require browser verification.
- No Docker executable/daemon available here. No production deployment, image vulnerability scan or independent security audit performed.

User-reported evidence: on 2026-09-28 the user confirmed v0.1.0 runs in the homelab and their measured stem dimensions printed accurately at 100% scale. This is evidence for that version/setup; repeat the smoke test after upgrading.

## Before production

Run npm test, npm run check and npm run test:browser; inspect the generated light/dark/mobile screenshots and PDF. Verify touch dragging, pointer cancellation and long-list scrolling on actual devices. Run the container smoke test and selected proxy configuration/TLS/host routing checks. Run full secret/image scans. Keep a pre-upgrade JSON backup and pin tested image digests. None of these pending checks should be represented as passed.
